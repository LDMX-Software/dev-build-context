There is a corresponding workflow in [ldmx-sw](https://github.com/LDMX-Software/ldmx-sw) that generates a [production image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ldmx/pro) using the image generated by this build context as a base image.
This production image already has ldmx-sw built and installed on it and assumes the user wants to run the application.

## Usage
The image is designed to be used with [`denv`](https://tomeichlersmith.github.io/denv/)
which provides support for Docker, Podman, and Apptainer.
